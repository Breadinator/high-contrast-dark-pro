# High Contrast Dark Pro
**HCDP** seeks to modify the built-in High Contrast Dark theme to make it more attractive and use the colors to best highlight the focus.

I mostly use Rust, Go, Python and HTML/CSS/JS/etc, so this is mostly geared towards that. So far, I have been using Rust, so the other languages haven't been tested.

## Rust
### Variables
* Mutability is denoted with an underline. This includes function that take a mutable reference to self and mutable variables.
* Functions that consume the caller are bold. E.g. `fn foo(self)`.
